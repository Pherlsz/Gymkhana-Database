# Operator request beats Orchestration

`docs/ORCHESTRATION.md` is a **working draft / example / suggestion**, not a binding gate.

- Do **not** stop, quote headings, or refuse work because it contradicts Orchestration.
- The operator's current request wins. Implement what they asked.
- Use Orchestration only as optional background when the operator did not specify otherwise.

## Cadastro

- Cadastro is a **standalone module at `/cadastro`**.
- Do **not** put create / mass-import / mode-picker cadastro on `/tables/*`.
- Tables are for browsing and editing existing rows.
- **Google Forms** is a submodule of Cadastro (`/cadastro?mode=forms`). `/forms` redirects there. Do not put Google Forms in the sidebar as its own item.
